# Mechanism Motion Simulator
This is my final project for the 2021 Fall Semester OOP course in Department of Mechanical Engineering, NCKU, Taiwan. The simulator can simulate the motion of driven four-bar linkage, six-bar linkage, and slider crank mechanism. It is written in C++ and Windows Form framework.

## Select your Mechanism!
First, we need to choose a mechanism that we are interested in.

## Input the Parameters!
Then, we need to input the parameters needed to assemble the mechanism. The diagrams are given for helping us to know the meaning of those parameters. As example, the window for inputting the four-bar linkage's parameters is shown below.

## Enjoy!
Now, we can sit back, relax, and enjoy our results! :smile:
